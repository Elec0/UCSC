** Procedure **
For Part 1, I was able to get the Hello World up and running pretty easily. My challenge came from figuring out how to
access the I/Os. Thankfully, after some Googling and the lecture I was able to understand TRISx and PORTx. Following that it wasn't
too terribly challenging to get the values of each of the switches and buttons. The switches and three of the buttons are right
next to each other in the register, so ANDing them with the register and enabling the LEDs that are spit out of the AND worked
quite well.

Part 2 was much faster, since I had the tools to atually communicate with the board. The longest time I spent on this 
part was fuiguring out how to switch the shifting of the bits to enable the LEDs from left to right to bounce the lights back and
forth. That is how I ended up doing the lighting up of the LEDs: taking a register with just 0b1 in it and left and right shifting
it and putting that value into the PORTE register to light the LEDs up.
I ended up using a flag variable to determine if the shifting was going left or right, and then used a BRQ to go to a certain
branch to shift left or shift right, which worked quite well.
