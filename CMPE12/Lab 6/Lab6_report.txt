** Lab 6, Section 2  **
***********************

** Procedure **
To start, I copied the starter file and ran it, making sure I got the expected output.
Following that, I effectively re-created the same logic from the LC3 decimal to binary converter.
Although with mips it was much faster and easier. Especially the subtraction and multiplication
made the lab much easier. 
The primary difference in logic between the old lab and this one was that we weren't getting input from the user,
rather reading from a string in memory. Because of this, I found it easier to write to the binary
string from right-to-left, which required offsetting the starting address by 31 and decrementing
as the loop looped.
